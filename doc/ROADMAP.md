# wlmaker - Roadmap

Vision: A lightweight and fast Wayland compositor, visually inspired by Window
Maker, and fully theme-able and configurable.

Support for visual effects to improve usability, but not for pure show.

## Plan for 0.2

* Issues to fix:
  * [done] Fix out-of-sync display of server-side decoration and window content when resizing.
  * Fix assertion crash when mouse is pressed, then moved to another toplevel, then released.
  * Hide window border when not having server-side decoration.
  * Fix issue with Chrome: Enabling "Use system title and boders" will pick a slightly small decoration.
  * Fix issue on resizing: When moving the mouse too quickly, focus is lost and the resizing stops.
  * Fix issue on fullscreen: The window border is kept, having the window off by 1 pixel.

* Experimental support for Dock Apps
  * [done] Experimental wayland protocol for Apps to declare icon surfaces.
  * Surfaces will be shown in either tile container, clip or dock area,
    depending from where the app was started.
  * Two demo DockApps included (digital clock; julia set).

* Support `xdg_shell`, based on toolkit.
  * [done] XDG Popups.
  * [done] Move and Resize, compliant with asynchronous ops.
  * [done] Maximize.
  * [done] Set title.
  * [done] fullscreen.
  * Minimize.
  * show window menu.
  * set_parent.
  * set app ID.

* Support `layer_shell`, based on toolkit.
  * XDG Popups.

* Support window decoration protocol, based on toolkit.
  * [done] Style of title bar, iconify and close buttons similar to Window Maker.
  * Window menu, with basic window actions (not required to adapt to state).

* Multiple workspaces, based on toolkit.
  * Navigate via keys (ctrl-window-alt-arrows, hardcoded).

* Dock, visible across workspaces, based on toolkit.
  * Keep track of subprocesses and the corresponding windows.
  * Style similar to Window Maker.
  * With application launchers (hardcoded).

  * Display the current workspace.
  * Buttons to switch between workspaces.

* Application launchers, based on toolkit.
  * Display an icon.
  * Display application status (*starting*, *running*).
  * Configurable (in code).

* Task List
  * Handles windows, rather than views.

* Window actions, based on toolkit.
  * Move ([done] drag via title bar, or [pending] window-alt-click)
  * [done] Resize windows, including a resize bar.
  * [done] Fullscreen windows.
  * [done] Maximize windows.
  * Minimize (*iconify*) windows.
  * Roll up (*shade*) windows.
  * Raise window when activated.

*  Visualization of iconified applications, based on toolkit.

*  Task list (window-alt-esc), cycling through windows, based on toolkit.

### Internals and code organization

* [done] Design a toolkit and re-factor the codebase to make use of it.
  * Ensure the main features (eg. all explicit actions and features above) are
    tested.
