# wlmaker - Roadmap

Vision: A lightweight and fast Wayland compositor, visually inspired by Window
Maker, and fully theme-able and configurable.

Support for visual effects to improve usability, but not for pure show.

See the [Detailed Feature List](FEATURES.md) for details.

## Plan for 0.7

**Focus**: Smooth resizing for surfaces and clean implementation.

* Clip & Dock handling
  * Add option to save state (Dock, Clip, Output).
  * Toplevel windows show an icon, unless started from dock.
  * There is a means to attach an icon to Dock or Clip (eg. via menu action).

* Cleanups:
  * Update wlmtk_window_t to use wlmtk_pane_t as principal container.
  * Recompute pointer focus max once per frame.

* Bug fixes
  * Resize-from-left jitter observed on the raspi or with gnome-terminal.
  * Particularly when using large decorations, there is resize jitter.

## Plan for 0.6

**Focus**: Multiple outputs.

* Support for dynamic output configurations.
  * [done] Support `wlr-output-management-unstable-v1` protocol.
    * [done] Verify that `wlr-randr` works, for `test` and `apply`.
    * [done] Fix: Report output position correctly.
    * [done] Verify that setting output position works as desired.
    * [done] Fix: Handle --on and --off, should remove output and re-position dock & clip.
  * [done] Support `xdg-output-unstable-v1` protocol.
    * [done] Verify that `wdisplays` works.
      * [done] Fix `wdisplays` crash when unsetting `Overlay Screen Names`: [Known](https://github.com/artizirk/wdisplays/issues/17) `wdisplays` issue.
      * [done] Fix positioning of overlaid screen names.
  * [done] Add `wlr-screencopy-unstable-v1` support.
  * [done] Test and verify: Multiple monitors supported. Supporting:
    * [done] per-monitor fractional scale.
    * [done] per-monitor transformation setting.
  * [done] `wlr-layer-shell-unstable-v1` implementation fixes:
    * [done] Update layer positioning to be respective to the panel's configured output.
  * [done] Permit `wlmaker.plist` per-output configuration, to persist layout.
  * [done] Explore if wlroots permits mirroring layouts. If yes: Implement.
    (Via outputs sharing the same position, through `wlr-randr` or `wdisplays`).
  * [done] Window (toplevel) handling on multiple outputs:
    * [done] Support and handle `wl_output` arg to `xdg_toplevel::set_fullscreen`.
    * [done] 'fullscreen': Fill the configured (or active) output.
    * [done] 'maximized': Maximize on configured (or active) output.
    * [done] When an output is removed: Re-position toplevels into visible area.
  * [done] Fix screen lock behaviour: Ensure the unlock surface is shown on all outputs.
  * [done] Permit specifying output for dock, clip and icon area (similar `KeepDockOnPrimaryHead`)
  * [done] Add "scaling" actions, configurable as hotkey and in root menu.
  * [done] Add "output configuration" item to the root menu. (eg. XF86Display key?)

* Menu
  * [done] Permit navigation by keys
  * [done] Generate from XDG repository ([#90](https://github.com/phkaeser/wlmaker/issues/90)).
  * [done] Documentation for menu configuration.
  * [done] Draw a submenu hint (small triangle) on items expanding into a submenu.

* Bug fixes
  * [done] Verify subprocess from action have stdout & stderr captured and logged.
  * [done] Fix keyboard input not working for Firefox.
  * [done] When switching workspace, pointer state appears to be reset.
  * [done] Test handling of mouse position when changing element visibility. Making
    an element visible should re-trigger focus computation.
  * [done] Verify handling of element motion() and button() return values.
  * [done] Fix non-updating wlmclock observed on non-accelerated graphics stack.

## Window Maker features

## Overall

* Window attributes
  * Build and test a clear model for `organic`/`maximized`/`fullscreen` state
    switches and precedence.

* Application support.
  * Icons retrieved and used for iconified windows. See [themes](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/icon-theme-spec/icon-theme-spec-latest.html).
  * Make use of XDG Desktop Entry [specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html).

* Configuration file and parser:
  * Support different background styles (fill, image).
  * Make semicolon-after-value required, for consistency with GNUstep.
  * Theme.
    * [done] Added ADGRADIENT fill style, aligned with Window Maker's diagonal.
    * Adds support for textures as fill (tiled, scaled, maximized, centered, filled?)
    * Add drag-modifier option, to configure when a drag makes a window move.

* Configurable keyboard map.
  * Verify support of multi-layout configurations (eg. `shift_caps_toggle`)
  * Support ChromeOS layout switch hotkey (`Ctrl+Shift+Space`)

* Configuration tool, similar to WPrefs.

* Compositor features
  * Bindable hotkeys.
  * Pointer position, to support apps like wmscreen or xeyes.

* Commandline flags to support:
  * icon lookup paths beyond the hardcoded defaults.

* Reduce Technical Debt
  * Move the setenv calls for DISPLAY and WAYLAND_DISPLAY into subprocess
    creation, just after fork. These should not impact the parent process.
  * subprocess_monitor: Use listeners, not callback.

* Exploratory ideas
  * Stretch: Consider supporting XScreenSaver (or visualization modules).

## Visualization and effects

* Animations
  * Launching applications, when *starting*.
  * Size changes (maximize, minimize, fullscreen).

* Task switcher
  * Application icons or minimized surfaces to visualize applications.
  * Animations when switching focus.
  * Clean up signal handling (emit on task switch, enable, disable).

* Resizing & moving
  * Consider visualizing windows partially transparent when resizing or moving.

## Dock Apps

* Sensors.
* Clock
* System tray.
* CPU load.
* Network monitor.
* Laptop battery status.
* Julia set.

## Non-Goals

* Do not (re)create a GNUStep environment.
* Creating a dedicated toolkit.
