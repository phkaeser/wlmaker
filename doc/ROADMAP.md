# wlmaker - Roadmap

Vision: A lightweight and fast Wayland compositor, visually inspired by Window
Maker, and fully theme-able and configurable.

Support for visual effects to improve usability, but not for pure show.

## 0.1 - MVP milestone

### Features

* [done] Support `xdg_shell`.

* [done] Support `layer_shell`.

### Internals and code organization

* [done] git submodule for direct and critical dependencies.
* [done] CMake as build system.
* [done] `test` and `doc` targets.
* [done] Published as open source.

## Plan for 0.2

* [done] Issues to fix:
  * [done] Fix out-of-sync display of server-side decoration and window content when resizing.
  * [done] Fix assertion crash when mouse is pressed, then moved to another toplevel, then released.
  * [done] Hide window border when not having server-side decoration.
  * [done] Fix issue with Chrome: Enabling "Use system title and boders" will pick a slightly small decoration.
  * [done] Fix resize issue with Chrome & Firefox: The content size and actual window size can differ, which led to jumpy resizes as get_size and request_size operations did not base on the same.
  * [not reproducible] Fix issue on resizing: When moving the mouse too quickly, focus is lost and the resizing stops.

* [done] Experimental support for Dock Apps
  * [done] Experimental wayland protocol for Apps to declare icon surfaces.
  * [done] Surfaces will be shown in either tile container, clip or dock area,
    depending from where the app was started.
  * [done] Demo DockApps included (digital clock)

* [done] Initial XWayland support
  * [done] Cover enough functionality to support xterm
  * [done] Enough functionality to support emacs in X11.
    * [done] Support for child surfaces.
    * [done] Positioning of popups
    * [done] Ensure stacking order is respected and used.
    * [done] Popups do not contribute to window extensions (no border hops)
    * [done] Cursor set appropriately.
    * [done] Set DISPLAY env variable appropriately.
    * [done] Handling of modal windows: Should have decorations, stay on top.

* [done] Configurable keyboard map (in code ~or commandline arg~)

* Support `xdg_shell`, based on toolkit.
  * [done] XDG Popups.
  * [done] Move and Resize, compliant with asynchronous ops.
  * [done] Maximize.
  * [done] Set title.
  * [done] fullscreen.
  * [done] Fix positioning of popups.
  * [regression, not supported] show window menu.

* [done] Support window decoration protocol, based on toolkit.
  * [done] Style of title bar, iconify and close buttons similar to Window Maker.
  * [done] No border shown when windows are not decorated (eg. chrome, firefox)

* [done] Task List
  * [done] Listing windows, rather than views.

* [done] Window actions, based on toolkit.
  * [done] Move ([done] drag via title bar, or [done] window-alt-click)
  * [done] Resize windows, including a resize bar.
  * [done] Fullscreen windows.
  * [done] Maximize windows.
  * [done] Roll up (*shade*) windows.
  * [done] Raise window when activated.

* [done] App Launcher: Update status for wlmtk_window_t, instead of
  wlmaker_view_t.

### Internals and code organization

* [done] Design a toolkit and re-factor the codebase to make use of it.
  * Ensure the main features (eg. all explicit actions and features above) are
    tested.

## Plan for 0.3

* Bugfixes

* [done] Screensaver support.
  * [done] Implement ext-session-lock-v1 protocol.

  * Ideally: With a Wayland protocol that permits running the dock and clip as
    separate binary, independent of the compositor.
