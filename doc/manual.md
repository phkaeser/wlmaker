## wlmaker

wlmaker is a [Wayland Compositor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(protocol)#Wayland_compositors),
designed to reproduce the behaviour of
[Window Maker](https://www.windowmaker.org/), which reproduces the elegant look
and feel of the [NeXTSTEP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXTSTEP) user
interface.

**Key features:**

* Compositor for windows in stacking mode.
* Easy to use, lightweight, low on gimmicks and fast.
* Highly configurable and human-readable [config files](#config_file).
* Dock and clip, with support for dockable apps.
