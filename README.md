# wlmaker - Wayland Maker

A [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/) compositor inspired by
[Window Maker](https://www.windowmaker.org/).

Key features:

* Compositor for windows in stacking mode.
* Supports multiple workspaces.
* Appearance inspired by Window Maker, following the look and feel of NeXTSTEP.
* Easy to use, lightweight, low gimmicks and fast.
* Dock and clip, to be extended for dockable apps.

How it looks, running in a window using the default theme:

### Current status

**Early access**: Wayland Maker covers elementary compositor functionality on single-monitor output. Please report what's missing or broken!

See [here](doc/FEATURES.md) for a detailed list of implemented or planned
features, or the [roadmap](doc/ROADMAP.md) for what's planned for the upcoming
versions.

Highlights for current version ([0.5](https://github.com/phkaeser/wlmaker/releases/tag/v0.5)):

* *new:* Window menu and [configurable](https://github.com/phkaeser/wlmaker/blob/main/etc/root-menu.plist) root menu.
* *new:* Fixes to `wlr-layer-shell-unstable-v1` implementation, early support for keyboard interactivity.
* Builds with [wlroots 0.18](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlroots/-/tags).
* Configurable layout and scaling for the output.
* Hot corners with configurable actions, default to 'lock' or 'inhibit' locking.
* Screen saver support, through `ext-session-lock-v1` and `idle-inhibit-unstable-v1` protocols.
* Configurable through plist text files: [base configuration](etc/wlmaker.plist),
  [style](etc/style.plist), [root menu](etc/root-menu.plist) and
  [docks & workspaces](etc/wlmaker-state.plist).
* wlr layer shell support (`wlr-layer-shell-unstable-v1`), fully implemented & tested.
* Appearance matches Window Maker: Decorations, dock, clip.
* Support for Wayland XDG shell (mostly complete. Bug reports welcome).
* Initial support for X11 applications (positioning and specific modes are missing).
  Use `--start_xwayland` argument to enable XWayland, it's off by default.
* A prototype DockApp (`apps/wlmclock`).
